# Parses out the actual `<remote> <refspec>` arguments of a `git push`, so the
# baseline diff-hash.sh computes matches what's really being pushed rather
# than always assuming "current branch vs its own upstream" — otherwise
# `git push <other-remote> <other-refspec>` would be checked against the
# wrong commit range and a stale marker could wrongly authorize it. Tokenizes
# the whole command with shlex (so quoted values like `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="John
# Doe" git push` don't break word-splitting), then splits on shell separators
# to find each logical sub-command, so env-var prefixes (`FOO=bar git push`)
# and git's own global options (`git -c x=y push`) before the `push`
# subcommand are still detected.
